## Running the simulation as a notebook

In this folder the Jupyter notebook **UBQC_notebook.ipynb** and the needed modules can be found. This provides a way to directly test the UBQC simulator without running it over the console. Instructions on running can be found in the notebook itself.

The notebook **benchmarking.ipynb** contains the security benchmarking calculations as a jupyter notbeook.

Furthermore the notebook **UBQC_shor.ipynb** provides the framework to test Shor's algorithm on the UBQC compiler, while this is not fully implemented yet.
