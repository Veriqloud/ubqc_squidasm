## Running the simulation as a notebook

In this folder the Jupyter notebook UBQC_notebook.ipynb and the needed modules can be found. This provides a way to directly test the UBQC simulator without running it over the console. Instructions on running can be found in the notebook itself.

Furthermore the notebook shor_ubqc.ipynb provides the framework to test Shor's algorithm on the UBQC compiler, while this is not fully implemented yet.
